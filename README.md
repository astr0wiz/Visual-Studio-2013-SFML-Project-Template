# Visual-Studio-2013-SFML-Project-Template
This is a project template for Visual Studio 2013 using SFML v 2.2. 

## Requirements
* Visual Studio 2013
* SFML 2.2 downloaded and installed
* Environment varable SFML_HOME set to location of SFML 2.2 (e.g. C:\SFML-2.2)

## Setup
The template is a ZIP file.  It must be placed in one of two directories, although I suggest placing it in your user directory:
 * [i]VisualStudioInstallationDirectory[/i]\Common7\IDE\ProjectTemplates\VisualBasic\1033
